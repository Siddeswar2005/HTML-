            <P1> The architecture of an application describes howits components are interconnected and howthey communicatewith each other. It can also be described as the connectionbetween the client and server that defines the connection, along with the server that handles the communicationbetween the client and server.
                Web applications are constructed following an architecturethat specifies how components are linked. The way the client and server connect is determined by the webapplication architecture. 
                The different levels of web applications’ size and complexityall follow the same architectural structure, but their detailsare unique. In addition to learning how a request-responseprocess functions and what components it includes, we’ll also cover how a simple request-response cycle works.
